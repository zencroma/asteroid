# Asteroid clone

Asteroid Clone is a 2D arcade shooter inspired by the classic "Asteroids" game. Built entirely in Python using the Pygame library, this project recreates the fast-paced, physics-driven gameplay that made the original a timeless favorite.




## Overview

In this game, you control a nimble spaceship tasked with navigating a hazardous asteroid field. Your primary goal is to survive for as long as possible by shooting and destroying incoming asteroids. As you hit larger asteroids, they break apart into smaller fragments, increasing the challenge and intensity of the gameplay.
## Features

- Experience authentic arcade action with spaceship controls that mimic real-world physics—featuring inertia, momentum, and friction.
- Asteroids split into smaller pieces upon impact, creating a progressively challenging environment.
-  The game is structured using object-oriented programming, making it easy to modify and extend with new features or power-ups.
- Leverages Pygame’s robust libraries for rendering graphics, handling input, and managing game events, ensuring smooth and engaging gameplay.


## Getting Started

1. Installation:
Ensure you have Python installed. Install Pygame using pip:
```
pip install pygame
```
2. Running the Game:
Clone the repository and run the main script:
```
cd asteroid-clone
python main.py
```
3. Gameplay Instructions:
- Movement: Use arrow keys (or WASD) to maneuver your spaceship.
- Shooting: Press the spacebar to fire bullets at the asteroids.
- Objective: Destroy as many asteroids as possible without colliding with them.
